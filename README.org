* README
This template *does not* meet the official requirements of academic paper.
* Font Setup
You should put the required font (SimSun, SimKai) files in the following path
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
~/.TeXmacs/fonts/truetype
#+END_SRC

Do not install Fandol font family since the TeXmacs would fallback cjk font to Fandol first.
