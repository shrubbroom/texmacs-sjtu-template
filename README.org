This template *does not* meet the official requirements of academic paper.
* Font Setup
You should put the required font (SimSun, SimKai) files in the following path
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
~/.TeXmacs/fonts/truetype
#+END_SRC
After you have placed the font file, run
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
texmacs --delete-font-cache
#+END_SRC
Do not install Fandol font family since the TeXmacs would fallback cjk font to Fandol first.
