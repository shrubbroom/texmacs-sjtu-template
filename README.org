* Font Setup
You should put the required font (SimSun, SimKai, FangSong\_GB2312,KaiTi\_GB2312) files in the following path
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
~/.TeXmacs/fonts/truetype
#+END_SRC
After you have placed the font file, run
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
texmacs --delete-font-cache
#+END_SRC
The TeXmacs hardcode its font substitutions. Therefore, you have to modify the ~font-substitution.scm~ by hand.
This file locates in
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $TEXMACS_PATH/fonts/font-substitution.scm
#+END_SRC
Add the following line to this file
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
((Times\ New\ Roman cjk) (SimSun))
#+END_SRC
This will fallback cjk font in Times New Roman to SimSun.
Other required fallback rules already exist in this file.
The document font should be

| en          | Times New Roman |
| cjk regular | SimSun          |
| cjk italic  | Kaiti\_Gb2312   |
| cjk bold    | SimHei          |
